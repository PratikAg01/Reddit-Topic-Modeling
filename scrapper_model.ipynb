       " \"A little bit of encouragement for those who are entering the CS job market for the first time (including me) Below is a short excerpt from [this website](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/manly-lessons/john-rockefellers-keys-to-success/) of John D. Rockefeller's job search 167 years ago. For those of you who don't know, Rockefeller was one of the wealthiest persons in modern history. This historical perspective helps encourage me to find a job, find solace in the process, and not give up. I hope it will be useful to you all as well.\\n\\n&gt;Rockefeller attacked this goal with the same patient persistence he had applied to his schoolwork. Wanting to find a position with a large and reputable establishment in which he’d have the greatest opportunities for learning and advancement, he made a list of the merchants, banks, and railroads with the highest credit ratings. Each day Rockefeller put on a dark suit, shaved, shined his shoes, and hit the pavement making inquires about town. “At each firm,” Chernow writes, “he asked to speak to the top man — who was usually unavailable — then got straight to the point with an assistant: ‘I understand bookkeeping, and I’d like to get work.’”  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;As Rockefeller remembered, the job market was tight, and the response was not encouraging: “No one wanted a boy, and very few showed any overwhelming anxiety to talk with me on the subject.” ***Yet young John D. was not at all discouraged***. A return to his home, and to dependence, was unthinkable. When he had gone through his whole list without an offer, he simply started at the top, and visited every establishment again, sometimes dropping into the same business three times. He treated his job search just like his job: “**I was working every day at my business — the business of looking for work. I put in my full time at this every day**.”  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;***Thus from morning until later afternoon, six days a week, for six weeks — sweating through Cleveland’s hot summer, walking its streets ‘til his feet ached — Rockefeller continued to seek a position***. Finally, on September 26, 1855, he heard the words he’d been waiting for: “We’ll give you a chance.” The ***small*** produce firm of Hewitt &amp; Tuttle was in urgent need of an assistant bookkeeper, and told Rockefeller to take off his coat and get to work right away.  \\n\\n\\nLook at the bright side. When you finally get that job, you'll be able to tell heroic stories to your children &amp; grand children of how you toughed through one of the hardest job markets in your life time to land your first job.\\n\\nAs they say, hard times create strong people. And when you're in a stable position some day, remember not to repeat the mistakes of the weak people who prospered during the easy times and who selfishly created the hard times for you all to suffer in.\\n\\nKeep calm, and carry on! 😊\",\n",

       " \"Palo Alto weird NAT issue Hi,\\n\\nI am working on a project right now and there is a change in ip address space of the ISP, they are moving from x.x.x.0/24 (old address space) address to y.y.y.0/24 (new address space). Both ranges are currently rout'able through the existing gateways but after the end of this week only y.y.y.0/24 will be available for us to use.\\n\\nThe current problem we are facing is that we already setup everything in y.y.y.0/24 address space in advance (interface, gateway, nat, security policy etc), but there seems to be some issue with NAT overload (trusted to untrusted) rules and we are seeing the issues mostly with SIP and RTP traffic. The issue is that even if we have configured ip y.y.y.y on the untrusted/outside interface and have a NAT rule for outbound traffic (to use interface), the firewall is taking the old ip configured on the outside interface (x.x.x.x). Not sure why it's behaving like this for SIP and RTP but most of the other traffic is using the new IP (y.y.y.y). \\n\\nWe verified if the traffic is hitting the correct policy using *test* and it's hitting the correct NAT rule and shows the correct translated address. But checking the active sessions using the *show session* commands shows it's not using the current interface ip but the old ip of the interface. We verified the output of the show session against the corresonding NAT rule and we can see the SIP/RTP sessions under that rule but using old ip as a translated source address.\\n\\nThe firewall is on 8.1 version and upgrading is not an option right now as we are in a process of migrating the firewalls. Tried clearing the sessions, removing and re-adding the NAT rule, but this buggy behaviour exist. Should I disable SIP ALG/inspection and allow traffic through security policy?\\n\\nApologies for the long post and any help is really appreciated.\",\n",
